<h2>Repository Description</h2>

As i mentioned in about section these are my php files that i worked on in Beltek Courses.
It was a 4 month course that our teacher first teached us the php basics and then how to manage MySql database and how to comunicate with database using php to make dynamic websites. 
And in this repository that each directory represents a one day in course.    

<br/>

<h2>Week 1-4 Explanation</h2>

In course's first 4 week we worked on computers that course provided us. And these computers were the official computers of the university so **we were not able store our files**.
But after first month we were able to use our personal computers so this repository has these files which ***starts with week 4***.      

<br/>

<h2>Repository Date</h2>

I went the Beltek Courses from **December 2018** to **March 2019**. 

<br/>

<h2>Repository Purpose</h2>

This repository is example for a reviewer to have an idea for how i work with php.
